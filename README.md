# Refactor of Horiseon's Website

In this project, I refactored the code for Horiseon's website (a company that specializes in SEO, online reputation management and social media marketing) to improve the website's accessibility, improve the the general readibility of the code, and to comform the website to Horiseon's mockup.    

## Specific Changes

The specific refactoring of the code included, without limitation, adding title information, adding accessibility information to the images, subsituting in semantic HTML elements where applicable, consolidating and organizing the CSS to shorten and simply the code, adding informative comments, repairing inoperable links, and re-sizing the main image, fonts and margins to conform the website to the client provided mockup.
